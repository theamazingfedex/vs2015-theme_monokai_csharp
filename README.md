# vs2015-theme_monokai_csharp
Every version of the awesome color theme Monokai that I've found for Visual Studio 2015 has ended up looking vastly different from any Monokai theme I have seen previously. This settings file attempts to re-create the old TextMate theme, with a focus on making C# code look better.

## Examples:
#### C#

#### XML
